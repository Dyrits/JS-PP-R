## PERSONAL PROJECT > Reduce
Reduce is a set of static methods using the `reduce()` method to simplify some very basic operations on array and object.  

- `Reduce.sum(array)` is used to get a sum of the numbers inside an array.   
- `Reduce.flat(array)` is used to flatten an array on one layer.  
- `Reduce.deepFlat(array)` is used to flatten an array on multiple layers (using recursion).  
- `Reduce.regroup(objectsArray, property)` is used to regroup an array of objects by values of a given property.  
- `Reduce.count(array, value)` is used to count the number of occurrence of a given value in an array.  
- `Reduce.countInArray(array, arrayValues)` is used to count the number of occurrence in an array of given values from an array of values. The result is returned as an object with each value occurring more than once as keys, and the number of occurrences as values.  
- `Reduce.countAll(array)` is used to count the number of occurrence of each item in an array. The result is returned as an object with each item as keys, and the number of occurrences as values.  
- `Reduce.reverse(array)` is used to reverse an array.  
- `Reduce.chunk(array, size)` is used to chunk an array into nested arrays of a specified size.  
- `Reduce.invert(object)` is used to invert the keys and values of an object.
